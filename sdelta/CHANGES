Made sdelta executable smaller, use less memory, and run faster.
The output format of sdelta patches has not changed
making this sdelta backward compatible with 20040926

Pavel Gorshkov <svinn@gmx.net> reports detailed information 
about how sdlta crashes on BSD which points toward a bug at 
the end of function natural_block_list that reallocates the 
memory for the natural block list smaller than it need be.
Intersting how linux gives a few more bytes 
for sloppy memory allocation than BSD allows.

Pavel Gorshkov <svinn@gmx.net> provided a patch for 
adler32.h that corrects endian detection on BSD.
sdelta is now confirmed to compile and run properly on BSD.
Thanks Pavel Gorshkov!

File ADVANCED has been updated with the following information:
1. Results of testing sdelta with the standard dictionary file 
on a large corpus of source tarballs and the problems and
benfits of using generic dictionary patching.
2. Potential use of 7zip high compression technology with sdelta 
technology and it's current savings over bzip2 for compressing a 
large and mostly compressible Sorcerer Install/Rescue ISO9660 image.

Pavel Gorshkov <svinn@gmx.net> provided a patch for
adler32.h that corrects endian detection on Solaris.
Problem with malloc and realloc on BSD may cause 
problems creating and using large sdelta patches
and creates a signifigant performance degredation 
over sdelta on linux.  To avoid the problem one may
want to install libdlmalloc from /usr/ports/devel/libdlmalloc
and then gcc -O2 -pipe *.c -ldlmalloc -lmhash -o sdelta
or export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libdlmalloc.so prior to
running sdelta.

Implemented changes for accepting input of sdelta patch
and dictionary file on command line for faster application
of sdelta patches on FreeBSD.  However the changes provide
negligible speed improvement on linux.

Thanks goes to Pavel Gorshkov <svinn@gmx.net> for finding
that successive calls to realloc on FreeBSD even with an
alternate malloc is far slower than a malloc.

Made changes and improvements resulting in 
30% speed increase in sdelta patch generation.
# make bsd
now compiles the source with the correct 
library links for use on FreeBSD.
