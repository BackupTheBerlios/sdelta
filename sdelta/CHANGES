Made sdelta executable smaller, use less memory, and run faster.
The output format of sdelta patches has not changed
making this sdelta backward compatible with 20040926

Pavel Gorshkov <svinn@gmx.net> reports detailed information
about how sdlta crashes on BSD which points toward a bug at
the end of function natural_block_list that reallocates the
memory for the natural block list smaller than it need be.
Intersting how linux gives a few more bytes
for sloppy memory allocation than BSD allows.

Pavel Gorshkov <svinn@gmx.net> provided a patch for
adler32.h that corrects endian detection on BSD.
sdelta is now confirmed to compile and run properly on BSD.
Thanks Pavel Gorshkov!

File ADVANCED has been updated with the following information:
1. Results of testing sdelta with the standard dictionary file
on a large corpus of source tarballs and the problems and
benfits of using generic dictionary patching.
2. Potential use of 7zip high compression technology with sdelta
technology and it's current savings over bzip2 for compressing a
large and mostly compressible Sorcerer Install/Rescue ISO9660 image.

Pavel Gorshkov <svinn@gmx.net> provided a patch for
adler32.h that corrects endian detection on Solaris.
Problem with malloc and realloc on BSD may cause
problems creating and using large sdelta patches
and creates a signifigant performance degredation
over sdelta on linux.  To avoid the problem one may
want to install libdlmalloc from /usr/ports/devel/libdlmalloc
and then gcc -O2 -pipe *.c -ldlmalloc -lmhash -o sdelta
or export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libdlmalloc.so prior to
running sdelta.

Implemented changes for accepting input of sdelta patch
and dictionary file on command line for faster application
of sdelta patches on FreeBSD.  However the changes provide
negligible speed improvement on linux.

Thanks goes to Pavel Gorshkov <svinn@gmx.net> for finding
that successive calls to realloc on FreeBSD even with an
alternate malloc is far slower than a malloc.


Fri Dec 31 20:39:52 UTC 2004	20041231	Kyle Sallee
Made changes and improvements resulting in
30% speed increase in sdelta patch generation.
# make bsd
now compiles the source with the correct
library links for use on FreeBSD.


Sat Jan  1 21:57:59 UTC 2005	20040101	Kyle Sallee
Made changes and improvements resulting in
25% speed increase in sdelta patch generation
over the previous day's release.
Very large files will result in less swap
thrashing during sdelta patch generation.
Compressed size of sdelta patches may either
increase or decrease a little due to these changes.


Mon Jan  3 21:00:43 UTC 2005	20040103	Kyle Sallee
Added leap frogging to expedite the location of the first
potential matching block resulting in a huge speed gain
proportional to the size of the files used to generate a delta.
Thanks goes to Pavel Gorshkov <svinn@gmx.net> for introducing
a one line change in blocks.c that slightly improve the speed
of which the natural block list is generated for files that
have lines exceeding 127 bytes.


Tue Jan  4 23:03:29 UTC 2005	20040104	Kyle Sallee
Made sorting faster.
Eliminated a bug in sdelta.c where I placed a
break when I really wanted a continue command.


Tue Jan 11 21:45:36 UTC 2005			Kyle Sallee
Using a new input.c to better support mmap reading of files
and anonymous mmap on stdin on Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris POSIX.
mmap of files instead of reading them into swap provides better
performance and less swapping when making sdelta patches of very
large files like the + 500M Sorcerer Install/Rescue ISO9660.

Introduced POSIX threading to sdelta generation that should
improve speed of sdelta generation on SMP boxes with adequate
RAM to avoid swapping or re-reading of mmaped files.


Sun Jan 16 22:11:32 UTC 2005	20040117	Kyle Sallee
Reviewed source to remove some insignifigantly buggy code.
Modified the way tag values are calculated to require the
crc for the desired block and following block to create
greater entropy in the ordered block list which yields
faster searches.


Wed Jan 26 10:54:30 UTC 2005			Kyle Sallee
Modified code to use 64 bit integers where
applicable instead of 32 bit integers.
This change causes minor slow down on 32 bit architecture
for occasional unnecessary 32 bit memory access.
However it may be faster on 64 bit architecture
where it can fetch 64 bits at a time and save
on an additional indexing.


Fri Jan 28 21:52:11 UTC 2005			Kyle Sallee
Thanks goes to Pavel Gorshkov <svinn@gmx.net> switching SHA1
generation from mhash to openssl since openssl is faster.


Fri Jan 28 21:52:11 UTC 2005	20050129	Kyle Sallee
Added sd BASH 3.0 script to wrap invocation of sdelta.
sd provides transparent compression and decompression
of source tarballs and sdelta patches.
This aught to make sdelta easer for POSIX novices.


Sun Jan 30 23:48:42 UTC 2005	20050130	Kyle Sallee
Fixed typos in Makefile reported by Ady Deac <adydeac@yahoo.com>


Tue Feb 22 02:25:32 UTC 2005	20050222	Kyle Sallee
Initial release and testing of sdreq client for
selecting sdelta patches to upgrade wanted sources,
make the request for generation of patches,
download the patches,
and apply the patches to generate the new source.
Email notification works however uploading
patch files via ftp is not yet tested.
The service may or may not be available until sdreq
and the server side code is completely debugged.


Tue Mar  8 01:34:55 UTC 2005	20050308	Kyle Sallee
The PPR now accepts two types of requests:  patches and tarballs.
However both the patch names and tarball
names must not specify a compression type.
Allowed:     bash-2.05b.tar-bash-2.05b.tar.sd
             bash-2.05b.tar
Disallowed:  bash-2.05b.tar-bash-2.05b.tar.bz2
             bash-2.05b.tar.7z
sdreq has been updated to act this way.
the PPR provides the smallest compressed patch
whether that patch for download may be called
bash-2.05b.tar-bash-2.05b.tar.sd.bz2  or
bash-2.05b.tar-bash-2.05b.tar.sd.7z
sdreq downloads the patch that is available.
Consequently, sdreq now requires p7zip installed since
some patches may not be available bzip2 compressed.
This change is entirely transparent to those using the sdreq client.

If you want a bash-2.05.tar.bz2 tarball then touch that
in your want directory and it will probably be provided.
If no suitable patch can be created then the smallest
bzip2 or 7za compressed tarball will be downloaded
instead and the compression type will be translated
to the type specified by the wanted filename.


Wed Mar 16 01:32:45 UTC 2005	20050316	Kyle Sallee
The sdreq client has been enhanced to generate better
matches between the sources a box has and wanted sources.


Tue Mar 22 22:40:52 UTC 2005	20050322	Kyle Sallee
New location/modification for downloading patches and sources.
This change was to make it easier to rsync mirror the PPR's
patches and optimially compressed source tarballs.
What used to be:
http://ibiblio.org/sdelta/patches/ and
http://ibiblio.org/sdelta/sources/  is now
http://ibiblio.org/sdelta/files/patches/
http://ibiblio.org/sdelta/files/sources/, respectively.

I finished the coding for sdelta 2.
The compressed patch files generated by sdelta 2
can be between 10% and 60% smaller than sdelta.
However there is a 3x increase in time required to make the 
patch and a small less than 1.25x increase in memory usage.
However the sdelta2 patches do apply faster.

Although 10%->60% smaller compressed patch files yields
faster downloads the impact upon overall patch savings
would be between 1% and 5% per patch.
Considering that the sdelta PPR is already running near
95% savings the enhancement could yield only an additional
2% savings at best.

You can make sdelta2 by typing make sdelta2, but you must
manually install it and I have not updated the sd wrapper
to support sdelta 2 archive files yet.


Tue Apr 19 21:19:22 UTC 2005	no release yet	Kyle Sallee
Slightly optimized sdelta2 code,
added support for sdelta2 patch files into the sd wrapper,
wrote SDELTA2_README to explain what it is.
